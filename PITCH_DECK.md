# MiD – My Decentralized Face Identity

## Vision
Empowering the next generation of secure, user-friendly authentication via decentralized, privacy-preserving face recognition.

## Problem
Passwords are insecure, hard to remember, and vulnerable to phishing and hacks. Current biometric solutions rely on centralized storage—creating privacy risks and single points of failure.

## Solution
MiD enables users to log in to web3 apps using their face, with all biometric data stored securely on their own device and identity managed via decentralized identifiers (DIDs) on the Polkadot blockchain.

## Why Now?
- Web3 and DeFi adoption is accelerating.
- Users demand better privacy and usability.
- Advances in browser APIs and blockchain make decentralized biometrics possible.

## MVP Features
- Face login (runs 100% in browser)
- DID-based authentication
- Easy integration for dApps
- Polkadot ecosystem support

## Business Model (sample)
- SaaS/API for dApp developers
- White-label enterprise solutions
- Transaction-based fees
